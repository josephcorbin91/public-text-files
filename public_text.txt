You okay now kind of taking a look at some of your thinking and situation from that point of view, okay. Some things kind of stand out for me and hearing you talk about what's been happening and your feelings I can appreciate. It's really painful. And I would say to the reader that you can step back and try to look at the thoughts. I think that you'll see it's it's helpful although I know It's a little difficult or unusual to separate feelings from thoughts sometimes. But I'd like to try to kind of distinguish between the two. Okay. You said that you've been at your job for about five years. You really like your job. So tell me about your job, like kind of how you felt about it, but frame it in a time before this ever happened.

So you remember accomplishing things at that job that you felt benefits society, the people you help.

You kept people safe. And you had a lot of satisfaction from the work you did. And now doesn't feel that way?

When you described it, it almost sounds like you talked about how you're afraid of making a mistake. You're thinking about yourself in a way where you're almost risk.

Your your work right now even though you have this one, situations extremely stressful and hard on you. You have other families that you interact with now to you tell me about those interactions.

So this is maybe what's different. This what you're saying from before till now? Is decisions seemed clear cut.

All right. So you're looking inward, you're looking at yourself a lot of self doubt. Now you're looking at decisions as much more difficult. It's much more difficult to come to the right decision. And second guessing sounds like move to second guessing a bit. When you do make a decision, like playing over over your mind. What could go wrong here? Is that the thought you're having?
